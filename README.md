# Project: Shell

* Author: Brian Wu
* Class: CS452 Section #002
* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

A shell built up from a skeleton with features including sequences, background tasks, redirections, pipelines, and several builtin commands.

## Reflection

The way to do this assignment was rather fun! It was challenging to thing about but the solutions to build up each feature were surprisingly intuitive given you understand how the program works!.

## Compiling and Using

To compile the code, first cd into the `hw2` directory.
Then, run this command 

```make```

and then...

```./shell```

OR... if you want to run immediately after building use

```make run```

Just make sure the file structure is not disturbed and all should be good!

Note: There is a regression tester that can be ran with ```make trytest```, but do note that some tests will not work because there expected output was ran on a machine that does not contain the same file path another machine would have when running the tester. Tread with caution!
